# multicalibration

### Linjun's Method
- `linear_model_r=1_multicalibration.py`: simple linear model with hand-implemented SGD for r = 1
- `deprecated_nn_multicalibration.py`: should be fixed
- `Debugging the Code`: sanity checks on Linjun's method (locally)
- `Linear Model Experiments`: sanity checks on Linjun's method (cluster)

### Hypothesis Validation
- `Logistic Regression Comparison.ipynb`: comparison of logistic regression distributions, accuracies
- `MNIST Calibration Test.ipynb`: original MNIST experiments with LeNet-5 (logistic regression dataset)
- `MNIST Calibration Test (Larger Models).ipynb`: original MNIST experiments with ResNet (logistic regression dataset)
- `Data Preparation for MNIST ResNet Test.ipynb`: hyperparameter tuning for the new experiment
