# multicalibration

###Linjun's Method
- `simple_multicalibration.py`: simple linear model with hand-implemented SGD for r = 1
- `multicalibration.py`: linear model implemented with NN for any r, d

###Hypothesis Validation
- `Logistic Regression Comparison.ipynb`: comparison of logistic regression distributions, accuracies
- `MNIST Calibration Test.ipynb`: original MNIST experiments with LeNet-5 (logistic regression dataset)
- `MNIST Calibration Test (Larger Models).ipynb`: original MNIST experiments with ResNet (logistic regression dataset)
- `Data Preparation for MNIST ResNet Test.ipynb`: hyperparameter tuning for the new experiment
